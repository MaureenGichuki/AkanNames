        Akan names 
    </p>
    <P class="tell">
        Akan names come from a customary naming framework for people from nations like Togo, 
        Ivory Coast and Ghana. A child's name is not set in stone by factors encompassing 
        their introduction to the world. For instance, the day of their introduction
        to the world or the way in which they were conceived may figure out which name 
        they get regardless of their orientation. 
        These Akan names imply the day one is born.
    </P>
    <p class="tell1">
        Depending on gender and day of the week one can tell their Akan name by their birthday.<br>
